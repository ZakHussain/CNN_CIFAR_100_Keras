# CNN_CIFAR_100_Keras
The Purpose of CNN_CIFAR_100 is to use Convolutional Neural Networks on the CIFAR 100 dataset using the Keras library. Here I define a baseline VGG model, define a regularization model that uses dropout regularizatio, and define a data augmentation model that uses RMSprop optimizer.
